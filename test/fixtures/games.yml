# Read about fixtures at http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/Fixtures.html

# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

# NOTE: I was getting inconsistent results using fixtures.  Therefore I had to comment them out.
# Tests would pass if I ran all of them at once.  If I then tried to run the integration test, it would fail.
